Leveraging libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for interactive charts, the script (pokemon_analysis.ipynb) allows users to explore Pokémon statistics like Attack, Defense, and Speed across different generations and types. The visualizations provide insights into trends, distributions, and outliers in the Pokémon universe, making this a great starting point for anyone interested in data analytics or Pokémon data exploration.
